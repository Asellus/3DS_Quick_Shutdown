<b><center>3DS Quick Shutdown</center></b>
==========

This app will shut down your 3DS upon running it. If you don't want to shutdown, just hold any button and it'll exit immediately. Works on both CFWs and *hax 2.X.

Requires [devkitARM](http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/devkitARM/) to build.

Based on https://github.com/thedax/3DSHomebrewTemplate. Shutdown code adapted from https://github.com/Cpasjuste/CtrBootManager.
